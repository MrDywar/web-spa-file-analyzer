Develop an ASP.NET MVC C # application.
The application should be implemented as (Single Page Application)
Use AJAX Technology
At least minimal design is welcome

Implement a one-page application for reading tabular data from a text file. The main application window is divided into two columns.

The first column contains the information necessary to read data from a file:
- The path to the file located on the server.
- Button to select a file located on the server. The file selection button brings up a pop-up window with the file structure of a specific folder on the server with the ability to select a file.
- Indicates whether the file contains a column description line. If the sign “whether the column description line is contained in the file” is false, the column names are filled with default values (for example, col_1, col_2, _col_3, etc.).
- Separator. The character used in the file as a column separator.
- "Read data" button. When the button is pressed, data from the file is serialized and on their basis the data display column is filled.

The second column displays the data read from the file in two tables.
The first table contains rows with column names. Realize the possibility of renaming columns with saving the results to a file selected in column 1 of the application. Renamed columns affect the display of the column headers of the second table.
The second table contains data from the table cells. Implement the ability to edit table cells with saving the results to a file selected in column 1 of the application. Implement the ability to add rows to the table.
